        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Marinate the chicken:

                In a bowl, combine chicken pieces, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander powder, salt, lemon juice, and chopped mint and coriander leaves. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (ideally, 1-2 hours for best flavor).</li>
            <li>Prepare the rice:
                
                Wash and soak the basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it is 70% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>For the biryani:
                
                In a large pan, heat oil or ghee. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook until the raw smell disappears.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken and cook until it is half done. Add the chopped tomatoes and garam masala. Cook until the chicken is tender and the gravy thickens.</li>
            <li>Layer the biryani:
                
                In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer the cooked rice and chicken masala alternately. Garnish with fried onions, fresh mint, coriander leaves, and saffron milk.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes. Once done, fluff the rice gently with a fork. Serve hot with raita or salan.</li>
