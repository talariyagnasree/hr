        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Marinate the chicken:
                In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.
                Coat the chicken well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (you can refrigerate it for a few hours or overnight for more flavor). </li>
            <li>2. Prepare the rice:
                Wash the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
                In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat.
                Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom) and sauté for a minute until fragrant.
                Add the washed rice and sauté for 2-3 minutes until the rice is lightly toasted.
                Pour in the water, add salt, and bring to a boil.
                Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the rice cook for 15-20 minutes until tender and fluffy.</li>
            <li>3. Cook the curry:
                In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat.
                Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
                Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and cook for another minute until fragrant.
                Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.
                Sprinkle in the cumin powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Mix well.
                Add the marinated chicken pieces along with the marinade. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is browned on all sides.
                Pour in the water or chicken broth to create a gravy. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors meld together.</li>
            <li>4. Serve:
                Fluff the rice with a fork and transfer it to a serving platter.
                Top the rice with the chicken curry and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                Serve hot with raita or salad on the side.</li>
