            <li> 1/4 cup urad dal (split black gram).</li>
            <li> 1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds (optional, for better fermentation).</li>
            <li> Water (for soaking and grinding).</li>

            <!-- <pre>--> 1. Soak the Ingredients: 
                Wash the rice and urad dal separately.
                Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in water for 4–6 hours.
                Soak the urad dal separately for 4–6 hours or overnight.
                2. Grind the Batter:
                Drain the water from the rice and dal.
                In a blender or wet grinder, first grind the urad dal with a little water to make a smooth batter. It should be fluffy.
                Next, grind the rice and fenugreek seeds together, adding water as needed to form a slightly coarse batter. It should not be too thick or too runny. You can adjust the water to get the consistency right.
                Combine both batters in a large bowl.
                3. Ferment the Batter:
                Cover the bowl with a lid or cloth and leave it in a warm place for about 8–12 hours, or until the batter ferments and rises. The batter should have small bubbles when it's ready.
                4. Make the Dosas:
                Heat a non-stick or cast-iron tawa (griddle) on medium-high heat.
                Once hot, lightly grease it with a little oil or ghee using a paper towel.
                Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the center of the tawa and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin layer.
                Drizzle a little oil or ghee on the edges of the dosa.
                Cook the dosa for about 2-3 minutes until the bottom turns golden and crisp.
                Once cooked, fold the dosa in half or roll it up.
                5. Serve:
                Serve your dosa hot with chutney (coconut chutney, tomato chutney, or any chutney of your choice) and sambar.
                Enjoy your crispy, delicious dosa! <!--</pre>  --></li>
